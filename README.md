This dataset contains sales information that I analyzed and cleaned by removing missing or inaccurate values to ensure accurate results. The data includes detailed information about products, sales, customers, and geographic regions. After the cleaning and analysis process, I created an interactive dashboard to track key performance indicators such as total sales, profit, discounts, and the number of orders, with the ability to analyze performance by category, region, or sales representative.
The goal of this analysis is to extract insights that help understand customer behavior, improve sales strategies, and support data-driven decision-making.
